  Maker: "The maker is the glassblower who crafts the glass",
  Gaffer:
    "The formal definition for someone that is sitting on the bench. The main artisian that crafts the glass.",
  Assistant:
    "The assistant for the gaffer. Usually brings tools, heats up tools, shields the gaffer, and blows the glass. Does anything to aid the gaffer.",
  FixtureEquipment:
    "Equipment that stays in place during the glass blowing process",
  CoolingEquipment: "Equipment that is used to cool the glass",
  HeatingEquipment: "Equipment that is used to heat up the glass",
  EnvironmentalEquipment:
    "Environmental equipment that is mostly to support the glass blower",
  Annealer:
    "Used to store the glass after the glass blowing process is finished. It makes sure the glass doesn't shatter from thermal shock from cooling down too fast. It lets the glass cool down at a slower temperature.",
  CompressedAir:
    "Compressed air used to cool down anything or any part of the glass that the glass blower wants",
  PipeCooler:
    "Used to cool down the pipe after any glass gathers. Shoots up water on the blow pipe or the punty rod so the glass blower can safely hold it",
  Marver:
    "Table used to shape the molten glass. It can also be used to put color on the molten glass",
  Yolk: "Support equipment used to hold the blow pipe or the punty rod while the glass blower puts the glass back into the glory hole. It is easier for the glass blower to be further away from the heat using a yolk",
  GloryHole:
    "Extremely hot furnace used to heat up the molten glass throughout the glass blowing process",
  PipeWarmer:
    "Used to heat up the pipe so the pipe is similar temperature to the molten glass during initial gather",
  Material: "Matter from which objects are made from",
  GlassMaterial:
    "Inorganic solid material that is often transparent and and brittle",
  ColorRod: "Material used to apply color to glass",
  Frits: "Crushed glass used for decorative purposes",
  Spruce: "Raw material typically used in glass blowing",
  Technique:
    "Various methods glassblowers can utilize to control the glass in some way",
  PressureTechnique: "Technique that utilizes pressure to shape the glass",
  GravityTechnique:
    "Technique that utilizes gravity to elongate and shape the glass",
  GripTechnique:
    "Technique that pertains to how the glass blower holds the blow pipe or the punty rod",
  BlowTechnique:
    "Technique that utilizes blowing into a blow pipe, soffietta, or another blowing device. It is usually used to expand the inside of the molten glass",
  SteamTechnique:
    "Technique that utilizes steam to apply pressure to the glass in the glass blowing process",
  CentrifugalTechnique:
    "Outwards applying force that the glass blower can utilize to the glass to shape the glass",
  CentripetalTechnique:
    "Inwards applying force that the glass blower can utilize to shape the glass",
  WeightedTechnique: "Technique utilizing weight to shape the glass",
  HandTools:
    "Tools that light enough to be mobile to be carried around by the glass blower. They can be picked up and carried around",
  PipeWarmerHandTools:
    "These describe tools that are gathered at the pipe warmer. These include punty rod and blow pipe as they need to be heated up so the temperature difference is minimal when gathering glass",
  StationHandTool: "These describe tools that are usually found on the bench",
  BlowPipe:
    "Tool that is used to hold the molten glass. Can be used to pick up glass during intial gather. The unique thing about this tool is that there is a hole on the edge which can be used to blow into. This would help the glass be expanded from the inside",
  PuntyRod:
    "Tool that is used to hold the molten glass. This tool is solid inside so can't be used to blow into the glass. Can be used to transfer the glass from the blowpipe at the end of the glass blowing process. Punty rod can also be used to gather glass at the start of the glass blowing process",
  Block:
    "Tool that is used to shape the glass. This tool allows the glass blower to shape the glass in a sphereical shape. Or it can be used to smoothen out edges of the glass. Usually made out of wood",
  Jacks:
    "Tool used to shape the glass. This tool can be used to pinch the glass or even expand the glass as well. Wax or other lubricant can be used on this tool to make it smoother",
  NewsPaper:
    "Tool used to shape the glass. There are layers of newspaper stacked on top of each other so it doesn't burn the glass blower's hand. The glass blower holds the newspaper to shape the molten glass",
  Paddle:
    "Tool used to shape the glass. This tool is typically used to flatten the molten glass. This tool can also be used by the assistant to protect the glass blower (gaffer) from the heat as well",
  Soffietta:
    "Conical tool in which the glass blower blows air into to expand the glass from the inside. ",
  Torch:
    "Tool used to control the temperature of the glass. This tool can give better control on which parts of the glass to heat up compared to the glory hole which heats up all of the glass",
  Tweezer:
    "Tool used to shape the glass. Tweezer can also be used to give support as well. Sometimes used to break the glass from the blow pipe. This is also used to pick up water",
  Water:
    "Water is used to cool the glass. Water is picked up by the tweezer and the glass blower can apply it anywhere on the glass",
